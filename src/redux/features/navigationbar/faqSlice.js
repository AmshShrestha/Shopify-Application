      question: `How to choose best theme for Shopify?`,
      answer: [
        `If you're thinking about setting up a shop on Shopify, one of the first things you'll need to do is choose a theme.
              With so many themes available, it can be tough to decide which one is right for your store. 
              Here are a few things to keep in mind when choosing a Shopify theme:`,

        `• Think about the overall tone and feel you want your store to have. 
              Do you want it to be playful and fun? Sophisticated and luxurious? Minimal and modern? 
              Your theme should reflect the overall tone and feel you want for your store.`,

        `• Consider what kind of products you'll be selling. 
              If you'll be selling mostly physical goods, you'll want a theme that includes features like product image galleries and robust product descriptions.
              If you'll be selling mostly digital goods, on the other hand, you might want a simpler theme that focuses on clean design and easy navigation.`,

        `• Think about your budget. 
              Shopify offers both free and paid themes, so you can choose something that fits within your budget. 
              Keep in mind, though, that paid themes usually offer more features and customization options than free themes.`,

        `If you're looking for a modern Shopify theme that is responsive and looks good on any device and has a lot of features, then you should definitely check Lumia Theme. 
              With its simple, clean interface Lumia makes it easy to get started.`,
